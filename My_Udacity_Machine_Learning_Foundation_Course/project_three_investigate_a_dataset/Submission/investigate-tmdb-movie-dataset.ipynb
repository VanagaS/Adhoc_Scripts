    "As per the project page, this data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. Being a movie buff myself, this is quite an interesting project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of information like genre, director, cast etc., which help us in analyzing how much each of these variables helped in a movie success. The dataset also consists of other important data like the revenue generated, popularity and average user votes. Based on all these datapoints mentioned above, we can evaluate (1) How successful a Movie is and (2) What has contributed to the success of the movie. Since the data also contains year of release, we can even get a chance to analyze the ongoing trend during a year and how that has helped in the additional success of a movie.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Distribution of revenue across popularity levels in the recent years\n",

    "We can see that the genre Drama are the most filmed in almost all generations. Only the 1980s are dominated by the comedy genre.\n",

    "\n",
    "In 1960s and 1970s, the top keywords was based on novel, which means movies with the keyword based on novel are released most.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "The goal in the research is primary to explore three parts of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part one: General Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "At part one, some general questions were explored. Movie popularity trend has been growing from 1960. Movies with higher revenue level are directly proportional with higher popularity based on recent five years data. Besides, movies with higher revenue level don't have the significant high score rating in recent five years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part two: Find the Attributes associated with Successful Movies\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes like cast, genre, production, keywords etc., that are associated with high popularity movies are analysed in terms of different high budget categories and run time categories. It is found that attributes associated with high popularity movies are higher budget levels and longer run time. Cast associated with high popularity movies is Robin Williams, Director associated with high popularity movies is Steven Soderbergh, Genres, Keywords & Producers associated with high popularity movies are no different than that of unpopular movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both runtime and budget didn't have obvious differences in high rating score. Low budget may have a higher rating or vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is found that the attributes that are associated with high voting averages are almost similar to the attributes that are associated with highly popular movies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part three: Top Keywords and Genres Trends by Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is observed that the number of movies released have been increasing year by year and that it is in the accelerated growth trend. In 1960s and 1970s, the top keywords were based on novel. In 1980s, the top keyword was nudity. In 1990s, independent film became the top keyword. And after 2000, the movies featuring woman director were released most.\n",
    "\n",
    "The genre Drama are the most filmed in almost all generations. Only the 1980s were dominated by the comedy genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of interesting information present in the dataset which can be explored in myriad of ways, some of which might provide some conclusive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "Data quality: It started with an assumption that zero values in revenue and budget column are missing. Zero valued revenue and budget data couldn't be deleted as it comprises more than 50% data. Some outliers have been found. As the popularity doesn't have an upperbound, it actually have the high probability of having outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### First research\n",
    "The distribution of popularity in different revenue levels in recent five years were analysed but the revenue levels were categorized based on their quantile. Whole revenue distributin is not calculated, so there may exist risks that the high revenue level still covers a wide of range, and may affect the final result. Analysis is provided based on data in the recent five years, while other years there could be different distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Second research \n",
    "The attributes have been associated with successful (popularity & vote_averages) movies. Attributes of high revenue are not calcuated as it is assumed that high revenue levels are with higher popularity which is found in research one. There can be several other factors that would have been resulted in high revenue movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Budget levels and runtime level properties were also analyzed, again, limiting the data to quantile data and not year by year. The keywords data was split into independent words and was counted. There could also be another analysis while keeping the combination of the keywords as it is and comparing accross the most successful and least successful. For example, a director might be good at particular combination of keywords and that would have provided more insight. Number of votes are not considered, so the rating score may be a biased."
